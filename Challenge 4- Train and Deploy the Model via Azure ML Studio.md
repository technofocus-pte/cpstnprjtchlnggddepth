it to an endpoint.

**Steps:**

1.  Open AML Studio

2.  Launch and run the notebook: fleet_model_train.ipynb

3.  Train model using fleet_cleaned_data

4.  Deploy the model

**Success Criteria:**

- maintenance_model endpoint deployed and active

- Can submit test JSON payload and get prediction
